<p>The smart charging concept is widely used in different fields and
applications. In <code>flextools</code> package, we define <em>smart
charging</em> as a tool to coordinate individual EV charging sessions in
order to obtain the optimal aggregated demand profile according to a
certain objective. There are different <strong>scheduling
methods</strong> to coordinate each session, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Postpone</strong>: shifting charging start time over
time</li>
<li>
<strong>Interrupt</strong>: stop charging during certain time</li>
<li>
<strong>Curtail</strong>: limiting charging power during certain
time</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, the charging sessions can be coordinated with
different objectives or goals, such as minimizing the interaction with
the power grid, minimizing the energy cost, participating in flexibility
or imbalance markets, not surpassing grid constraints or capacity
limits, accomplishing with demand-response programs, etc.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> aims to provide a
framework to simulate any of these situations to analyze the impact and
benefits of electric vehicle flexibility.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="smart-charging-algorithm">Smart charging algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#smart-charging-algorithm"></a>
</h2>
<p>We have divided the smart charging algorithm contained inside
<code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> function in two different stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Setpoint calculation for the aggregated EV demand curve</li>
<li>Scheduling of the individual sessions to match the setpoint of the
aggregated demand</li>
</ol>
<p>Below, we will briefly explain the process performed in each one of
theses steps.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setpoint-calculation">Setpoint calculation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setpoint-calculation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>setpoint</em> for the aggregated EV demand is understood as
the desired, optimal or allowed power demand, depending on the objective
and characteristics of the control over the charging points.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>flextools</code> allows the following methods to
define the setpoint of the aggregated EV demand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Setpoint as <strong>maxium EV demand</strong>: a maximum EV
demand capacity profile can be configured as a constrain to coordinate
charging sessions below the limits. This must be set for every EV user
profile in the charging sessions data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Setpoint as <strong>optimal EV demand</strong>: the optinal EV
demand is calculated based on a Quadratic programming optimization to
minimize the interaction with the power grid (see <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_net_power.html">Net
power optimization</a>), the energy cost (see <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_cost.html">Energy
cost optimization</a>) or both (see <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/combined_optimization.html">Combined
optimization</a>), setting the parameter <code>opt_objective</code>
accordingly. Internally, the <code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> function is
making use of the <code><a href="../reference/optimize_demand.html">optimize_demand()</a></code> function internally,
using parameters <code>direction="forward"</code> to postpone EV
sessions and <code>time_horizon=NULL</code> to exploit their flexibility
until the end of the optimization window.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="scheduling-algorithm">Scheduling algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scheduling-algorithm"></a>
</h3>
<p>The scheduling method is defined by the parameter <code>method</code>
in the <code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> function, which can be
<code>"postpone"</code>, <code>"curtail"</code>,
<code>"interrupt"</code> or <code>"none"</code>. If
<code>method = "none"</code>, the sessions schedule is not modified and
the calculated setpoints are returned as a optimal results. If
<code>method</code> is different than <code>"none"</code>, after
obtaining the setpoint

(i.e. optimal load), the scheduling algorithm follows the sequence below
for every time slot
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>t</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>

<p>4.2. Select flexible sessions (see definition below) and set a
priority order</p>
<p>4.3. Go to next time slot if no more flexibility is available</p>
<p>4.4. Coordinate flexible sessions to match the setpoint</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stop if no more flexibility is available</p></li>
<li><p>Return the new schedule of EV sessions</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To classify a connected EV as a <strong>flexible session</strong> or
not, the <code>flextools</code> package defines the following conditions
according to smart charging method used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Postpone</strong>: the EV has not started charging yet, and
the energy required can be charged during the rest of the connection
time at the nominal charging power. From all flexible sessions in a time
slot, the ones connecting earlier will have priority over the later
sessions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Interrupt</strong>: the charge is not completed yet, and the
energy required can be charged during the rest of the connection time at
the nominal charging power. From all flexible sessions in a time slot,
the ones that have been charging during less time will have priority
over the sessions that have been already charging (rotation
system).</li>
<li>
<strong>Curtai</strong>l: the charge is not completed yet or will
not be completed in the current time slot, and the energy required can
be charged during the rest of the connection time at a lower power than
the nominal charging power.</li>
</ul>
<p>The energy and power constraints of these conditions can also be
defined in function <code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> with the parameters
<code>energy_min</code> and <code>charging_power_min</code>,
representing the minimum allowed ratios of the nominal values. More
information about using these parameters can be found in article <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/smart-charging-advanced.html">Advanced
smart charging</a>.</p>

<p>On top of these energy variables, we can simulate some charging
sessions using the <code>evsim</code> package, which provides the
function <code><a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evsim/reference/get_custom_ev_model.html" class="external-link">evsim::get_custom_ev_model</a></code> to create a custom EV
model to later simulate EV sessions with
<code><a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evsim/reference/simulate_sessions.html" class="external-link">evsim::simulate_sessions()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>We can create an EV model with custom time-cycles and user profiles.
In this case, we will consider just one EV user profile (see the <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evprof/articles/evprof.html" class="external-link">EV
user profile concept</a> from package <code>evprof</code>), “HomeEV”,
which will represent a “charge-at-home” pattern starting in average at
18:00 until next morning.</p>

peak hours while, if they were coordinated, they could make a more
efficient usage of the power grid. Following, you will find some
examples about how to coordinate these EV sessions using
<code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> but first of all let’s start with a
minimal example.</p>
<p>Let’s simulate smart charging with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimization objective “grid” (minimizing interaction with the
grid)</li>
<li>Scheduling method “curtail” (reducing charging power when
required)</li>
<li>no contextual data for optimization (<code>opt_data</code> will be
just a date time sequence)</li>
<li>optimization window: starting at 6:00AM and with a length of 1 day
(24h)</li>
</ul>

<span>  window_start_hour <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">6</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The object returned by function <code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> is
always list with 3 more objects:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/names.html" class="external-link">names</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">sc_results</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">## [1] "sessions"  "setpoints" "demand"    "log"</span></span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>setpoints</strong>: time-series data frame with the optimal
setpoints of the EV demand</li>
<li>
<strong>sessions</strong>: coordinated EV sessions’ data frame
according to the setpoint</li>
<li>
<strong>log</strong>: list with messages about the smart charging
algorithm (flexibility needs and availability, sessions modified, etc.).
This is empty by default and filled with messages when
<code>include_log = TRUE</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, if we print the results we see a summary of the charging
sessions that have been participating in the smart charging program,
differentiating them between <em>Considered</em>, <em>Responsive</em>,
<em>Flexible</em> and <em>Exploited</em>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html" class="external-link">print</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">sc_results</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">## Smart charging results as a list of 3 objects: charging sessions, user profiles setpoints and log messages.</span></span>
<span><span class="co">## Simulation from 2023-05-01 to 2023-05-05 with a time resolution of 15 minutes.</span></span>
<span><span class="co">## For this time period, there were 3 smart charging windows, where:</span></span>
<span><span class="co">##   - 15 sessions were considered ( 100 % of total data set).</span></span>
<span><span class="co">##   - 15 sessions were Responsive ( 100 % of considered sessions).</span></span>
<span><span class="co">##   - 15 sessions were Flexible ( 100 % of responsive sessions).</span></span>
<span><span class="co">##   - 15 sessions were Exploited ( 100 % of flexible sessions).</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This classification is done by the smart charging algorithm according
to the optimization window hours, the <code>method</code> and the
sessions’ features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Considered</strong>: charging sessions that charge within
the optimization windows and are not considered outliers (their
connection times fit the 95% percentile).</li>
<li>
<strong>Responsive</strong>: charging sessions that accept to
participate in the smart charging program. The ratio of responsive
sessions from every EV user profile is configured with the
<code>responsive</code> parameter.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexible</strong>: charging sessions that are flexible in a
specific time slot. This depends on the session’s features and the
scheduling <code>method</code> (as described in the <a href="https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/smart_charging.html#scheduling-algorithm">Scheduling
algorithm</a> section).</li>
<li>
<strong>Exploited</strong>: charging sessions that have been
modified in a a specific time slot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure illustrates the classification of sessions
according to smart charging program participation:</p>
<p><img src="sessions_classification.png" alt="Smart charging sessions classification"></p>
<p>Also note that after applying the smart charging, the
<code>sessions</code> object from the results has more rows than the
original <code>sessions</code> object. It is not the number of total
charging sessions that has increased, but <strong>all flexible sessions
have been divided in multiple time slots</strong>. This allows to modify
the charging power of every time slot to 0 (postpone or interrupt
methods) or between 0 and the nominal power (curtail method).</p>
<p>In the following example you can see how <code>Session</code> “S1”
has a different <code>Power</code> value in different time slots:</p>

<p>Also, the parameter <code>opt_objective</code> must be set to
<code>"none"</code> in order to skip optimization, since the setpoint
for the smart charging algorithm will be given by the
<code>opt_data</code> column named “HomeEV”.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>which smart charging method should we use?</strong>
Let’s compare them, considering optimization windows of 24 hours from
6:00AM to 6:00AM.</p>
<p>First we can try with the <strong>postpone</strong> strategy setting

instead of start charging right at the connection time during peak
hours. This is not a problem if all EVs are completely charged during
their connection times, but it may suppose a risk for the late EV
connections that have to wait until all previous sessions have been
charged. This issue is solved with the <strong>interrupt</strong>
strategy, where a rotation system is designed to charge a similar amount
of energy to all connected EVs.</p>

individual sessions are interrupted to enable new sessions to charge,
for a better equality among EV users. However, both postpone and
interrupt methods do not provide high flexibility in terms of power
since the individual charging power can’t be reduced. In that sense, the
<strong>curtail</strong> method provides a higher flexibility potential
to adapt the EV demand to more variable or fluctuating signals such as
flexibility markets or energy prices.</p>

<!-- The demand is being postponed by the smart charging algorithm to match the setpoint during all possible hours, but when the end of the optimization window is reaching, the vehicle must charge to accomplish with the energy required by the EV user. This means that all EV users are not able to charge all their requirements under these grid conditions.  -->
<!-- There may be some scenarios where the charging point operator can assume this kind of impact to the user in order to mantain grid stability, so we can also consider that is not mandatory to fill the batteries of all vehicles. This can be configured with the parameter `energy_min`, as the required minimum ratio of the energy required by the EV user. Let's try a value of `energy_min = 0` to see how the algorithm works and the corresponding impact to the vehicles: -->
<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- We see that the curtail strategy is the one with lowest average impact on the users, in contrast to postpone which has the highest impact, specially in late charging sessions. Therefore, we can say that, if we want the EV users to charge at least 50% of their energy requirements, the only suitable strategies are curtail and interrupt. -->

evening peak hours. To solve this issue, the EV sessions can be
coordinated with the building demand profile to obtain a lower
aggregated peak. This can be done with function

be completely flat, shaving the peak, if the EVs can be coordinated to
match the setpoint. We can also compare the net power profile from the
static and flexible case with the parameter <code>original_df</code>. In
this plot we clearly see the added value of EV flexibility to reduce the
impact to the grid during the evening peak.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the EV demand from our “HomeEV” user profile occur
mainly during evening peak hours, which is a problem for grid congestion
but also for the EV user since they are also the most expensive hours
(with dynamic tariffs):</p>

function requires a data frame with the total <code>consumption</code>

static and flexible cases by using the <code>original_df</code>

<p>Even though we can talk about two different objectives, there could
be a situation where we want to minimize the energy cost under certain
grid constraints. In these cases, the optimization objective should be
“cost” as well, but we can make use of the <code>grid_capacity</code>
variable configurable in the <code>opt_data</code> parameter from
<code><a href="../reference/smart_charging.html">smart_charging()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>grid_capacity</code> variable in the <code>opt_data</code>
tibble represents the maximum consumption, not only for the EV demand
but also the rest of static demand
(<code>consumption = building + EV</code>):</p>
