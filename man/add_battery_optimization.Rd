\arguments{
\item{opt_data}{tibble, optimization contextual data.
The first column must be named \code{datetime} (mandatory) containing the
date time sequence where the optimization algorithm is applied.
The other columns can be (optional):
\itemize{
\item \code{static}: static power demand (in kW) from other sectors like buildings,
offices, etc.
\item \code{import_capacity}: maximum imported power from the grid (in kW),
for example the contracted power with the energy company.
\item \code{export_capacity}: maximum exported power from the grid (in kW),
for example the contracted power with the energy company.
\item \code{production}: local power generation (in kW).
This is used when \code{opt_objective = "grid"}.
\item \code{price_imported}: price for imported energy (€/kWh).
This is used when \code{opt_objective = "cost"}.
\item \code{price_exported}: price for exported energy (€/kWh).
This is used when \code{opt_objective = "cost"}.
\item \code{price_turn_down}: price for turn-down energy use (€/kWh).
This is used when \code{opt_objective = "cost"}.
\item \code{price_turn_up}: price for turn-up energy use (€/kWh).
This is used when \code{opt_objective = "cost"}.
}}

\item{opt_objective}{character or numeric.
Optimization objective can be \code{"grid"} (default), \code{"cost"} or \code{"curtail"}, or
a number between \code{0} and \code{1} to perform combined optimization
where \code{0 == "cost"} and \code{1 == "grid"}.}

\item{Bcap}{numeric, capacity of the battery (in kWh)}

\item{Bc}{numeric, maximum charging power (in kW)}

\item{Bd}{numeric, maximum discharging power (in kW)}

\item{SOCmin}{numeric, minimum State-of-Charge of the battery}

\item{SOCmax}{numeric, maximum State-of-Charge of the battery}

\item{SOCini}{numeric, required State-of-Charge at the beginning/end of optimization window}

\item{window_days}{integer, number of days to consider as optimization window.}

\item{window_start_hour}{integer, starting hour of the optimization window.}

\item{flex_window_hours}{integer, flexibility window length, in hours.
This optional feature lets you apply flexibility only during few hours from the \code{window_start_hour}.
It must be lower than \code{window_days*24} hours.}

\item{lambda}{numeric, penalty on change for the flexible load.}
