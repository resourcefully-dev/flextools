Function `optimize_demand()` and `add_battery_optimization()` makes use of Quadratic programming in order to obtain the optimal power load given certain conditions. The Quadratic programming problem can be formulated according to multiple objectives. Currently, `flextools` package allows to optimize a time-series power load considering two different goals:

* Minimize the power exchanged with the grid (net power)
* Minimize the energy cost

In this article, we'll cover the optimization problem for the first objective, **energy_cost minimization**, for both the **flexible demand** (e.g. heatpumps, electric vehicles, etc.) and the **battery**.

Our energy cost optimization takes into account multiple profiles of energy prices with the objective to minimize the total cost, considering:

* Imported energy cost
* Exported energy income
* Income from balancing markets (turn up/down demand)


# Demand optimization

To minimize the energy cost using the **flexibility from a power demand profile**, the objective function of the optimization problem has been raised in the following way:

$$
min \sum_{t=1}^{T} I_t·PI_t - E_t·PE_t - PTU_t(O_t-LF_t)  - PTD_t(LF_t-O_t) + \lambda (O_t-LF_t)^{2}
$$
  
The objective function and constraints of this optimization problem are represented below, where:

- $T$ : Number of time intervals within the optimization window
- $G_t$ : Local power generation time-series vector
- $LS_t$ : Non-flexible load time-series vector
- $LF_t$ : Flexible load time-series vector (if not optimized)
- $O_t$ : Optimal flexible load time-series vector
- $I_t$ : imported energy
- $E_t$ : exported energy
- $PI_t$ : imported energy price
- $PE_t$ : exported energy price
- $PTU_t$ : balancing price for turn-up power
- $PTD_t$ : balancing price for turn-down power
- $\lambda$ : penalty on change for the flexible load


Moreover, this optimization problem has the following constraints:
  
* The energy consumed by the flexible load must remain the same than the expected behavior:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^T O_t \Delta t = \sum_{t=1}^T LF_t \Delta t
$$

* Optimal flexible load must be lower than a certain maximum power $LF_{max}$:

$$
0 \le O_t \le LFmax_t \quad t \in T
$$



* The imported energy must remain between 0 and the corresponding energy consumed with the maximum grid import capacity $IC_T$:

$$
0 \le I_t \le IC_t \Delta t \quad t \in T
$$

* The exported energy must remain between 0 and maximum grid export capacity $EC_t$:

$$
0 \le E_t \le EC_t \Delta t \quad t \in T
$$

* Energy balance behind-the-meter:

$$
I_t - E_t = O_t + LS_t - G_t
$$


At the same time, we can optimize the flexible energy demand with two opposite approaches:

a. Postpone the consumption to later time-slots (**shift the energy forward**)
b. Consume now (store) the energy that will be consumed later (**shift the energy backward**)

We consider both approaches for different objectives or applications. The energy shift is always done within a maximum **time horizon** ($h$) to consider realistic scenarios. For example, the time horizon for the energy demand of a water boiler could have a time horizon of 6 hours, because it wouldn't make sense to heat the water more than 6 hours before the final consumption. Each one of these approaches brings extra constraints to the optimization problem:

If the energy can only be shifted **forward**:

* The cumulative sum of the optimal load $O$ must be higher than the cumulative sum of the original flexible load $LF$ except the last $h$ time slots, and lower than the total cumulative sum of the original flexible load $LF$ (energy can only be shifted forwards):
    
$$
\sum_{t = 1}^{u-h} LF_t \le \sum_{t=1}^u O_t \le \sum_{t=1}^u LF_t \quad u = 1 \dots T
$$

* The maximum values for the optimal demand $O_t$ will depend on the time horizon $h$:

$$
O_u \le \sum_{t = u-h}^u LF_t \quad u = 1 \dots T
$$


If the energy can only be shifted **backward**:

* The cumulative sum of the optimal demand $O$ must be higher than the total cumulative sum of the original demand $LF$ (energy can only be shifted backwards), and lower than the cumulative sum of the original demand $LF$ except the following $h$ time slots:
    
$$
\sum_{t=1}^u LF_t \le \sum_{t=1}^u O_t \le \sum_{t=1}^{u+h} LF_t \quad u = 1 \dots T
$$

* The maximum values for the optimal demand $O_t$ will depend on the time horizon $h$:

$$
O_u \le \sum_{t = u}^{u+h} LF_t \quad u = 1 \dots T
$$

# Battery optimization

To minimize the energy cost using the **flexibility from a battery**, the objective function of the optimization problem has been raised in the following way:

$$
min \sum_{t=1}^{T} I_t·PI_t - E_t·PE_t - PTU_t·B_t  - PTD_t·(-B_t) + \lambda \sum_{t=1}^{T-1}(B_{t+1} - B_t)^{2}
$$


Where:

- $T$ : Number of time intervals within the optimization window
- $G_t$ : Local power generation time-series vector
- $L_t$ : Power load time-series vector
- $B_t$ : Optimal battery power time-series vector. Positive charging, negative discharging.
- $I_t$ : imported energy
- $E_t$ : exported energy
- $PI_t$ : imported energy price
- $PE_t$ : exported energy price
- $PTU_t$ : balancing price for turn-up power
- $PTD_t$ : balancing price for turn-down power
- $\lambda$ : penalty on change for the flexible load

Additionally, this optimization problem also counts with the following parameters used in the constraints below:

- $B_{cap}$ : Battery capacity
- $B_c$ : Maximum charging power
- $B_d$ : Maximum discharging power
- $SOC_{min}$ : Minimum state of charge of the battery
- $SOC_{max}$ : Maximum state of charge of the battery
- $SOC_{ini}$ : state of charge at the beginning/end of the optimization window
  

Optimization constraints:
  
* Battery power (positive = charging, negative = discharging) limits:

$$
-B_d \le B_t \le B_c \quad t \in T
$$

* State of charge limits:

$$
SOC_{min} \le SOC_{ini} + \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T B_t \Delta t}{B_{cap}} \le SOC_{max} \quad t \in T
$$

* The balance of charged/discharge energy must be 0 at the end of the optimization window to have the same initial state of charge at the beginning of every optimization window:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^T B_t \Delta t = 0
$$

* The imported energy must remain between 0 and the maximum grid import capacity $IC_t$:

$$
0 \le I_t \le IC_t \Delta t \quad t \in T
$$

* The exported energy must remain between 0 and the maximum grid export capacity $EC_t$:

$$
0 \le E_t \le EC_t \Delta t \quad t \in T
$$

* Energy balance behind-the-meter:

$$
I_t - E_t = B_t + L_t - G_t
$$
